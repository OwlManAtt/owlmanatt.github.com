title: Ghettocron
---

Ghettocron is an emulation of a real UNIX Cron daemon - a time-based scheduler that will execute a certain program at a specified time.

<h3>Crontab</h3>
<p>The list of cron jobs to run is traditionally stored in a crontab text file. In the Kitto Ghettocron system, this file is replaced by the cron_tab table in the database. The two important columns in this table are cron_frequency_seconds, which defines how many seconds must pass before the job is run again, and cron_class, which specifies what class to instantiate when running the cronjob.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Job</h3>
<p>Creating a new cronjob is easy. First, create a new class file in includes/cronjobs/. Your class should implement the Job interface and have a constructor that takes in a database connector as the first argument. You must defined the #performJob() method to do whatever work your cronjob needs to do.</p>

<?php
class Job_BanEveryone implements Job
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct(&$db)
    {
        $this->db = $db;
    } // end __construct

    public function performJob()
    {
        $this->db->query("UPDATE user SET access_level = 'banned'");
    } // end performJob
} // end Job_BanEveryone
?>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Etymology</h3>
<p>The term <em>ghettocron</em> is believed to have been coined by one of the Knight brothers at the dawn of the twenty-first century whilst he was working on the original Operation: Pet Game codebase.
