title: Debugging ActiveTable
---

<p>ActiveTable has the capability to output a ton of useful debugging information, using either PEAR::Log or just printing to the user's screen. Two attributes control logging, <em>debug</em> and <em>logfile_path</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, you would want to utilize the debug logs if you want to see the queries ActiveTable is generating for you (if, for example, you're getting an invalid query generated) or if you'd like to see the performance of a certain query.</p>

<h3>Use</h3>
<p>To have it log to a file:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class Foo extends ActiveTable
{
    protected $table_name = 'foo';
    protected $primary_key = 'foo_id';

    protected $debug = true; // Defaults to false
    protected $logfile_path = '/tmp/active_table.log'; // This is the default value
} // end Foo class
{% endhighlight %}

To have your log messages outputted to the screen, set <em>logfile_path</em> to null instead of setting a path:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class Foo extends ActiveTable
{
    protected $table_name = 'foo';
    protected $primary_key = 'foo_id';

    protected $debug = true; // Defaults to false
    protected $logfile_path = '';
} // end Foo class
?>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Logged Events</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Every SQL query executed is logged.</li>
    <li>The execution time for every query executed is logged.</li>
    <li>The total execution time for (most) methods is logged, along with the fact that they were called.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extending</h3>
<p>The method <em>#debug(mixed $message[,string $type])</em> is called to perform logging. Redefining this method to do something else is the easiest way to change the global logging behavior.</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class My_ActiveTable extends ActiveTable
{
    protected $debug = true;
 
    // This is an example - I do NOT recommend you do this - even one pageload would
    // send you dozens of emails!
    protected function debug($message,$type='info')
    {
        send_email('admin@yourdomain.com',"[$type] ActiveTable Debug Event!",$message);
    } // end debug
} // end My_ActiveTable
 
class Foo extends My_ActiveTable
{
    protected $table_name = 'foo';
    protected $primary_key = 'foo_id'; 
} // end Foo class
?>
{% endhighlight %}
