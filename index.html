title: Welcome to Kitto!

Welcome to KittoKittoKitto, a virtual pet game template app.
 
Kitto's goals are simple:
    
<ul>
    <li>Help new petgame developers get off the ground as quickly as possible. Writing the whole register/login/boards/adopt pet thing over and over is a pointless waste of time.<br /><br />
 
      That said, it is not within the scope of Kitto to provide *everything* you would see in a run-of-the-mill petgame. What is in this package is every major feature a basic installation of Kitto is going to provide.<br /><br />
      
      There is no battle stadium or trading post. There are not even user shops! The purpose of Kitto is to provide *the very basic* components.  It is my personal belief that providing *too much* functionaility will just encourage dozens of sites using the Kitto code and *no* custmizations to speak of will spring up.<br /><br />
      
      Your game should be unique - but that does not mean you should waste time re-inventing the wheel. I will probably be publishing several extensions to Kitto to add those functions, but they will be optional (and, of course, Free) add-ons.</li>
    
    <li>Help educate brand-new and novice programmers by giving them a well-designed application to hack away at. The code in Kitto will (hopefully) service as an inspiration light of Best Practices and Brilliantly DRY code to the next generation of pet-game developers.<br /><br />
    
      I started programming because of petgames. Three years later, I work for an ISP doing web applications. I want that to happen to you, too - it's fun, it's good experience, it makes money. I built a career because of what I learned, and I am all about sharing that experience with whoever is willing.</li>
</ul>
