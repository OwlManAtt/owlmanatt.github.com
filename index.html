Welcome to <strong>KittoKittoKitto</strong>, a completely <strong>free virtual pet game</strong> framework for you to build upon.
 
<h3>About</h3>
<p>KittoKittoKitto (or Kitto for short) is a virtual pet game framework. Kitto is meant to serve as a starting point for building your own unique game. This application is Free; you can download it and modify it as you see fit.</p>

<p>Kitto has been in development since August 2007. It's a PHP framework that adheres to the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller'>MVC pattern</a>.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Help new petgame developers get off the ground as quickly as possible. Writing the whole register/login/boards/adopt pet thing over and over is a pointless waste of time.<br /><br />
    When you're getting your team together and coming up with The Next Big Idea, you're building up a lot of positive energy. Excitement for the unique and wonderful things that you're going to be building. Kitto allows you to dive straight in to building your incredible breeding system or putting together a revolutionary battle arena - you can skip by weeks of boring scripts like registration, user management, forums, and private messages.<br /><br /></li> 

    <li>Help educate brand-new and novice programmers by giving them a well-designed application to hack away at. The code in Kitto will (hopefully) service as an inspiration light of Best Practices and Brilliantly DRY code to the next generation of pet-game developers.<br /><br />
    
      I started programming because of petgames. Years later, I work for an ISP doing web applications. I want that to happen to you, too - it's fun, it's good experience, it makes money. I built a career because of what I learned, and I am all about sharing that experience with whoever is willing.</li>
</ul>
